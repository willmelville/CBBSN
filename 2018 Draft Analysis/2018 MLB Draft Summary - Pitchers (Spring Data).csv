He presents two fastballs, four-seam(91-93) and two-seam(87-90). The four seam was primarily used up in the zone to blow by hitters, while the two-seam was used as a groundball-inducing pitch, which worked with the inducing of 12 groundouts(1 double play). Throws from the 3/4 arm slot has easy and clean mechanics. Changeup is an excellent pitch, uses off of fastball and generated some ugly swings and sat 80-83. Breaking ball is more of a slurve type, speed of a slider and break of a curve, sat 84-86. It's effective in spurts, but leaves pitch over plate when he starts to tire. Has some command issues that show when he reaches the order the second time around. Tries to be too fine. However, overall this pitcher has the repetoire to be a strong groundball pitcher in the back end of a rotation.",2697,6,30,693,54

He uses a high 3/4 slot with a smooth and repeatable arm action. He stands on the third base side of the rubber. His landing is slightly towards the first base side of the mound, though, causing him to have to throw a little bit across his body. His fastball sat in the mids 80s in the first inning, but settled around 83 mph the rest of the game. It has some natural arm side run, which compliments his high 70s/low 80s cutter. The cutter is probably his best pitch, as even though it does not usually have heavy break, it has late break. Bargfeldt used the pitch to generate swings and misses and ground balls. The changeup flashed average, but mostly lacked good fade or drop. It was better at the bottom of the zone or lower. He did not use the curve often, and when he did it was more of a show me pitch. He hung one early in the game that was hit hard for a homerun. He cannot afford to miss his spots with the curve. Bargfeldt did allow three walks, but in general showed good command and control. If he is going to be anyhting more than an organizational player, he will have to further develop the command.",2977,41,79,8400,40

He has so many moving parts in his windup that I almost would prefer he throw exclusively from the stretch, where he might find better command/be able to maintain deception with the different arm angles he throws his pitches from. He throws his fastball from two different arm slots, with his more traiditonal arm slot yielding 85-87 MPH, and his borderline side arm version more in the lower 80s. He's got a great pitcher's frame, and I think he might have a little more in the tank. His stuff was inconsistent, and he was all over the plate with his arsenal. As a result, a good hitting USF team crushed several fastballs off of him. He didn't utilize his breaking ball often in his abbreviated start (I think the short start was by design due to the upcoming AAC tournament), but when he did it wasn't as crisp as the last few times I've seen him. I think at his peak, it will be his best pitch/one he throws majority of the time. There were two scouts there to watch him, and both told me their respective teams viewed J.T. as a reliever long term.

Attacks hitters in the zone, starting fastballs on the corners and using his killer CH as his out pitch. While he sits high-80s with the fastball, and the curveball is a clear 3rd best pitch, the changeup played professionally versus Columbia--with tail outside to RHHs, it generated misses on 12 of the 23 swings against it, and 10 chases. When they were not missing the pitch, Columbia was tapping weak ground balls right back to Kleiman. If he avoids the long ball (2 solo homers allowed thru 9), his changeup can take him to a higher level.",2482,12,109,774,48

Induced a lot of groundballs, in which most were weak contact. Pitches to contact and does not try to overpower the hitter with his stuff. He's aware of his skills. Changeup seldom thrown and is noticeably different from the fastball, easy to pick up. Has average command across his fastball and curve.

Standing on the first base side of the rubber, he works exculsively from the stretch. There is some effort to his delivery, but he is athletic enough that he should be able to improve his control at least a half grade. The fastball has some natural run to it, and generates lots of swings and misses. The slider is the real weapon though, as it has heavy late break that fool hitters. In the look I had, no hitter even bothered to swing at the pitch, even though Haynes landed many of them in the zone. Especially on his front door sliders, Haynes made right handed hitters extremely uncomfortable in the box. If he moved to the third base side of the rubber, he may be even more deceptive for right handed hitters. He did not throw any changeups in my look, and without a third pitch, he is likely destined to be a reliever. If he can improve his control, his slider could carry him to the majors. His ceiling is probably that of a solid middle reliever.",2412,903,99,342,41
