He looks a little stocky, and his weight seems like something that he will have to pay attention to for as long as he plays baseball. I'd put a Eugenio Suarez comp on his body/surface level profile, but Suarez started out as a skinnier/agile shortstop, so Villar has some work to do if he wants to remain on the left side of the infield. He won't blow you away with athleticism, twitchiness, or his arm, but I did see him show range to his glove side when he made a great diving stop to throw the runner out at first. I have him as a FV 45 at 3B, but I think that'll play just fine as long as he can keep himself from getting too heavy. At the plate, Villar stands closed off, with loose hands that rest near his back shoulder with a slight bat wiggle. A big leg kick initiates the loading of his hands, after which he explodes through the ball with solid upward plane to his swing. Standing closed off is a direct attempt to hunt for pitches middle/away, which he showed during his second at-bat when he roped a ball to RF. Standing closed off potentially leads Villar to be susceptible to heaters inside, but I think he has fast enough hands that he won't struggle catching up to those pitches to the point where it will hinder his ability to hit. He has some definite swing and miss issues, which I think is exasperated by his immature approach at the plate. He was a free swinger all day, and I think if he is more selective about which pitches he wants to drive, he can help to mitigate the swing and miss issues a little bit. I think Villar definitely gets drafted this year, probably in the 10-20 round range, and I will be interested to see how his tools play up in professional ball.",46

His arm is his best tool and would profile at any spot. He showed good footwork and glovework in the field in my look. In his stance, he keeps his hands fairly quiet near his shoulder. Just before the pitch comes, he lifts his back leg, shifting his weight to the front, then uses a leg kick to shift his weight back. This double shifting of weight may cause timing issues, especially on offspeed pitches. He needs to improve his pitch recognition, as he swung over several breaking balls in my look. His large frame and good bat speed suggest he should have average power, but he will struggle to reach that level in games because of his swing and miss.

He is built like Adam Dunn, and has massive forearms, but is much leaner than the former MLBer. There's really not much more room for growth for him, as he is a RS-Sr. and has maxed himself out at this point. He is more athletic than one might think for his size, but isn't great at first. He lacks the soft hands/reflexes necessary to field the ball consistently/scoop bad throws, and his arm is average at best. Watching him run down the first base line is like watching a car drive with square wheels, and I don't anticipate any gains in the speed department. At the plate, he has below average bat speed and bit of a lengthier swing. He has a wide open stance, and has quiet hands that he holds high by his back shoulder. The ball doesn't jump off his bat in the way that you would like to see, but the power is legit, and you can tell if he gets a hold of a ball it's going to go far. He has 19K's/19BB's on the season, and all of that contact has led to a super impressive slash line of .350/.417/.689 with 14 HRs. Despite that, I really wasn't overly impressed with him as a player, and am not confident in his ability to succeed at the next level. He is old relative to his competiton, and I am not sure what type of pitching he sees in the Horizon League. Someone will draft him, and I think he deserves that shot. I just don't see a very high ceiling here.",48

The struggle may be getting the ball into the air, if he does, he pulls off and has lofty fly balls, however can be fixed into a just-below average hit tool with average pop.

His swing works well to lift the ball and get the most out of his raw power. The worrisome aspect of his swing, though, is his trigger is dropping the bat behind his head before bringing it back up in order to swing, and all that motion may make it harder to catch up to higher velocities.

He wasn't overly fast, but I'd be interested to get a few more home to first times on him to validate the below average times I clocked him at during the game. In the outfield, he looks perfectly capable of getting to all the balls he needs to, and flashed a borderline 60 arm from RF during in-and-outs. At the plate, Burdick stands with a wide open stance, with his hands up by his back shoulder. He has a slight bat wiggle that speeds up the closer the pitcher is to throwing the ball, and he initiates his swing with a smooth/rhythmic leg kick. He swings hard, and has natural loft and quick hands. I think at his peak, he will be able to hit for above average power, and his fast bat should allow him to handle more advanced pitching. He's not a five tool guy, or even someone to be overly excited about, but his actions at the plate paired with his strong arm/competency in the field should make him a draftable player down the road.

He looks agile enough to stick at short, and showed good footwork and quick hands. He has an above average arm, and gets some impressive zip on the ball. For the most part, he didn’t get stagnant with his feet on his throws, although he did make a throw flat-footed in game and bounced the ball to first. He will have no problem finding a home at second if short doesn’t work out for him. He’s not exceptionally fast, although it is by no means a deficiency for him. He’s a switch hitter, and I got the chance to see both of his swings. Mechanically, they’re functionally the same. He has an open stance, and stands with his hands low, much like Francisco Lindor. He has a slight bat wiggle, and a short/compact swing that allows him to generate plus bat speed. I think his hands starting lower coupled with his fast bat will allow him to generate loft on his right handed swings, leading to a gap to gap profile. His swing isn’t built for power, and I doubt he ever runs into average power, although anything is possible if he makes the necessary adjustments. In the one at bat I saw him take from the left side, it looked like it was geared towards slapping the ball around the diamond, and not driving the ball. Throughout the game, Conley got a steady dose of breaking balls, which is to be expected by a high school pitcher with below average stuff. He did a good job of fighting off pitches, and showed a discerning eye at the plate. Overall, he looks like a player, and I think he showed enough for me to comfortably say he plays like a player too. Would want to see him again, though, since he had a relatively quiet game.",47

He has above average to plus raw power and above average contact and bat speed and solid plate discipline. Giesler has average speed and runs the bases well. There is not much more room for Giesler to grow, he is maxed out physically. Giesler has a wide stance and his stride while swinging makes it larger.

I stumbled upon Dingler after watching his smooth righthanded stroke at the plate, and although he had a quiet game, I feel like he has the opportunity to be a big time player in the coming years. He's only a freshman, but posesses a tantilizing combination of height and a lean/athletic build. He has plenty of room to fill out, which when paired with his swing, leads me to believe he has above average raw power in the tank somewhere. He is listed as a catcher on their depth chart, but played CF during the game. He had a strong arm on his throws during in-and-outs, and showed enough for me to give him a 60. His footwork and reads looked fine during pregame, but he didn't have anything hit his way unfortunately. His home to first time left something to be desired in the speed department, but I'd venture a guess that he's a tick faster than I clocked him at. I'm really interested to see how he looks behind the plate (or if he plays there anymore), but don't think he will have trouble playing a solid LF/RF and a fringy CF. At the plate, he stands with his legs shoulder width apart in a slightly open stance. His hands are aligned with his back shoulder, and he has a soft bat wiggle pre-pitch. He has great actions to his swing, specifically how he starts his lower half during his bat load, which contributes to his plus bat speed. His swing allows him to drive through his lower half, and he generates natural loft in his swing. Dingler is really smooth across the board, and although he still needs refining on his approach at the plate, I really like his potential to develop 5 average/slightly above average tools at his peak.",47

He's got a great frame with big forearms and a sturdy lower half, and should have no problem enduring the grueling nature of a long baseball season. He is listed as a catcher/infielder on their website, but I only got to see him play 1B this weekend. He looked perfectly fine out there, but didn't really have much hit his way throughout the game. I'd be interested to see him behind the dish, as his bat paired with solid catching defense could make him extremely valuable. I didn't get a home to first time on him, but he doesn't exude plus foot speed, so I'm comfortable giving him a below average grade in that department. At the plate, he stands open, with some of his weight on the ball of his front foot. He holds his hands close to his body, with a smooth bat wiggle and his elbow cocked. He has an abbreviated leg kick that starts his swing, which is extrememly compact and quick through the zone. I don't think he will struggle with plus velocity at higher levels because of how fast his swing is. His last AB, Genord hit a monster HR to left field, and showed off his bat speed/natural loft in his swing. One final thing of note is that he was the leader of team stretches pre-game, which is something I like to see from catchers, and shows that he is a leader/respected by his teammates. I liked Genord at the plate, but his future for me will be determined by how he looks behind the dish defensively.",47

He has good size and long legs, although his upper body is a little skinny. He ran an underwhelming home to first time, but looks slightly faster than what I clocked him at. I didn't see anything from him defensively, but he has a .994 fielding percentage on the season and has only made 1 error. This leads me to believe he is perfectly competent at short, although he doesn't appear to have that typical agile/twitchy atheticism that professional shortstops need. I would need to watch him again to make a determination on if he has the tools to stick at short longterm. At the plate, he stands in the box with a wide stance, with his back elbow up and his bat at a 45 degree angle by his back shoulder. As the pitch is about to be delivered, his bat wiggle becomes more pronounced, although not to the point where it is a detriment to his timing. Although it is of little consequence, I feel like it is necessary to add to the dirtbag label I've given him by mentioning that he doesn't use batting gloves when he hits. He is a ""foot down"" guy, and barely lifts his leg when initiating his swing. There isn't a lot of natural loft in his swing, so I don't project him to run into much power at his peak, although his compact swing/above average bat speed should help him spray balls gap to gap. Givin is having a great junior year, but probably won't be an impact guy in pro ball based on his lack of standout tools.",46

He had a quiet game overall, but flashed some of the same tantilizing yet unpolished skillset he also possesses on the mound. He looked small on the bump, but while I was standing at field level his lanky frame actually makes him look bigger at the plate. He has a wide stance that spans the entire box, and pairs that with a rhythmic bat wiggle pre-pitch. He has more of a pronounced load with his hands that you might normally see, but his bat speed is plus, leading me to believe that he won't have issues catching up to upper level pitching. He has a compact stroke and swings hard-- showing a concerted effort to drive the ball. While he does have 8HRs on the year/generates some natural loft in is swing, I think he saps some of his raw power because of his ""get the foot down"" mentality; there's more in the tank if he wants to make that adjustment. He struggled with breaking ball recognition throughout the day, and swung over the top of some chase pitches. The fact that he swings as hard as he does in the box, coupled with some inconsistency against breaking balls, translates to some inherent swing and miss. I think because of his quick hands he will make plenty of contact down the road, and the raw power is an added bonus. Defensively, I didn't see any balls hit to him during the game, but from what I've gathered, he's not great in the field. Not that fielding percentage is everything, but he's sitting at .897% with 9 errors on the year playing mostly at 2B. He isn't especially smooth and doesn't appear to have the quick reflexes and soft hands to play up the middle. He may fit in better at 3B based on the potential in his bat and his plus plus arm. As a draft eligible sophomore, teams will have to decide where Grammes profiles best (although there have been precedents set recently with two-way players), and if he is ready to make the next step to pro ball. Personally, if Grammes is available anywhere from round 10 on, I might draft him based on his physical tools, and figure out the rest after.",51

He has a big frame and does not project to fill out any more. He has a slightly open stance, keeps his hand high with a lot of bat movement, and a long leg kick when swinging. Kelly has above average raw power with average contact tool and fringy pitch recognition. Kelly’s best tool is his blocking and receives. Despite being tall, Kelly gets low in his stance, and receives the pitch well and blocks everything in the dirt. Kelly has below average arm strength, but flashes average. Since Kelly is athletic, he could transition to first if his arm strength does not improve. Kelly’s ceiling is a backup catcher, and most likely an organizational catcher.",46

My biggest concern is his balance at the plate. Once he begins to face faster pitching, he may struggle to make solid contact. His hands will not help his cause either due to the fact that he doesn't load up before swinging. Lunceford's best trait is his baseball IQ. He is a very smart player with regards to his approach and baserunning skills. He fields his position fairly well and should be able to save at least a few runs over the course of a season.

McGowan has a mature/stocky frame and less than ideal height to pair with it. He looks strong in his legs/forearms, but also could stand to lean out a little-- which would help his movement patterns on both defense and offense to be less stiff. He DHed for me, but he is listed as a utility guy on their website. He took in-and-outs at 3B, where he showed average hands and an arm that was just good enough to grade at a 50. He looked clunky when he had to charge and throw on the run, and I'm skeptical if he could play the position at a higher level given his body type. As one can imagine, he's not very fast, which presents problems when you start to think of other possible spots on defense for him. His hands/reflexes might not be twitchy enough to play a good 2B, and he's shorter than what you'd like your 1B to be. I think he probably settles in at either 2B or LF (and may see time at 3B sparingly), but never plays average defense. At the plate, he has a wide stance and stands slightly open. His hands are held stiff by his back shoulder with his elbow cocked. During his swing, his back elbow raises even more dramatically, and his bat head slightly wraps around his head. I think this wrap helps him to generate upward plane on his swing, but also slows his hands down during his swing. A slight leg kick helps his hips drive through the ball, although I still don't love his actions at the plate. He does appear to have an advanced feel of the strike zone, and took controlled hacks at pitches he thought he could drive (mostly fastballs), which helps his hit tool play up for me. I put a 55FV on his hit tool, but that is pretty generous, and if there was ever a tweener between a 50-55, McGowan would be it. He is a positionless bat first guy with holes in his swing and a bad body, which isn't super intriguing to MLB teams. That's not to say he doesn't have a few decent tools, or that he couldn't drastically alter his body through work in the weightroom/proper nutrition. I just am not super excited by his overall makeup.",45

He's really struggled at the plate this year, and looked out of sync for me today. He's servicable at third/can make all of the routine plays, but I think his bat/skillset would fit better at second (or even in LF). He's faster than his home to first time showed, considering the fact that he slowed down when he got close to the bag. He doesn't have great size, and is a ""dirtbag"" type of player. He has an open stance at the plate, with his feet spread a little wider than shoulder width apart. He holds his hands high with a small bat wiggle, and an aggresive leg kick initiates his swing. The leg kick allows him to generate above average bat speed, and make the most out of his thinner frame. He has good plane in his swing that will help him extra base hits. I still like his longterm ability to hit despite the struggles this year, but don't think he will run into much power ever.",46

While I didn't leave blown away, there are quite a few things to like about his game, mainly with his bat. Northcutt has a stumpy/mature frame, and really doesn't look like a prototypical athlete. He is about to turn 19, which makes him old relative to his competition, not to mention he legitimately looks like a college player out there. I wouldn't project much more with his body, although I do think his underwhelming speed might tick up once he develops some lean muscle. Defensively, he pairs below average twitchiness/athleticism with a plus arm, a combination that yields a 45 grade for his defense. He should be able to make most of the plays, but his lack of consistent soft hands and clunky movement at times will hinder him from ever becoming an average 3B. I really don't know where you play him, because he's probably too slow to play a corner outfield spot. Ideally, he sticks at 3B, where he increases his value defensively playing a tougher position than one like 1B. At the plate, Northcutt sets up with his feet wider than shoulder width, with his back leg angled inwards. He has a quiet bat pre-pitch, and his leg kick and hands work together in sync when he is gearing up to swing. His mechanics look a lot like Josh Donaldson's, and his swing generates similar upward plane. His fast hands were evident when he swung, despite the fact that he didn't truly square up any balls today. He used wood the entire game, and at one point he weakly hit a high fastball and drove it into deep center, showing off some of the raw pop he is known for. One thing that really stood out to me is how mature his approach at the plate is. He didn't take one bad swing the entire game, and showed an advanced feel of the strike zone/getting the barrell to the ball. This feel for hitting is what makes me confident that he will be able to swing it at the next level, even if he is somewhat of an enigma defensively.",50

Despite being 200 lbs already, his large frame could add on more muscle. He is very aggressive at the plate, swinging at most pitches in the strike zone. He begins his stance standing tall, but drops down to a more athletic position with a wider base during his leg kick. The drop in eye level could lead to some issues tracking the ball, but the stance could be simplified to mitigate that concern. When he makes contact, the ball jumps off the bat due to his good bat speed. At third, he moves better in on the ball than laterally, and his average arm is probably good enough to stay at the position. His aggressiveness at the plate may need to be toned down, but if he does that and adds some weight to his large frame, his bat could be a carrying tool. ",37

I came away impressed at some of his overall tools, but he is still raw as a player. He has a slight frame and isn't super tall, but he is still young and will have time to grow/put on muscle as he matures. Defensively, he averaged a 2.03 pop time for me, but two outlier data points might have made the average a little higher than it truly was. He was borderline sub-2, with an above average arm that he was able to utilize to place throws perfectly in front of the bag. His arm action wasn't necessarily clean, but it gets the job done. He was 1/2 on the day with stolen base attempts. He has good hands, and shows the reflexes to snatch balls in an attempt to frame them. He doesn't ""stick"" his frames consistently, receives the ball too close to his body, and struggled at times to block balls. I would expect him to improve as he becomes more experienced, though, and think he will be an above average catcher down the road. I didn't get a home to first time on him, but his speed looked underwhelming. At the plate, stands with his feet shoulder width apart in an open stance. He keeps his hands close to his back shoulder, with a controlled bat wiggle pre-pitch. His slight leg kick initiates his swing, which is compact and stays through the zone well. He has quick hands, and gets the barrell to the ball well for a kid his age. He's got some loft to his swing, but simply isn't strong enough to drive it for game power at this point. I think at his peak, he will develop a borderline plus hit tool, and slightly below average power. I have seen three prep catchers this spring (including Tyler McDonough and Keegan Fish), and I think Powell is a nice mixture of both; not quite as projectable at C as Fish, and not quite as good of a hitter as McDonough.

If he can improve his positioning on defensive, he should become a significantly better outfielder.

He keeps his bat head in the zone through his swing, and while he has some power, he is more contact over power at this point.

His swing path is excellent, he shifts his weight to his back leg well, he creates a rubberband effect with his hands, and he has great bat speed. He should continue improving his swing at the next levels of competition. The rest of his game is average right now, but should continue to improve with more practice and repetitions. He is solid defensively as a center fielder and runs the bases fairly well. My two biggest concerns are his lack of size and his lack of aggressiveness at the plate. He almost seems to lack a killer instinct, which may come back to haunt him against pitchers who will go right after him. Overall, however, Veal should prove himself to be a solid asset for any organization in the future.",43

He's perfectly fine in LF, but won't blow you away with his defense or arm. He made a few bad reads today, was pulled in the 6th, and immediately went to the locker room. That leads me to think he might have been hurt/sick, which could have contributed to him not being super sharp at the plate or in the field. At the dish, Wiemer has loud mechanics. He stands upright, with his hands held by his shoulders. His leg kick and hands work in sync, with his hands dropping down/loading when he begins his leg kick. He uses his lower half well to drive through the ball, and generates plus bat speed/raw power. Normally I like quiet mechanics, but Wiemer makes the swing work for him. His pull heavy approach, as well as the numerous moving parts in his swing, might keep him from ever developing an average hit tool, but the power is definitely there. He is only a freshman, and will be someone to watch in the coming years. He's a little stiff in the field, and could make a move to first down the road, where his bat would play nicely.",47
