He came into the game with runners in scoring position, but he looked comfortable and confident and kept the runs off the board.  I think he is mentally tough for sure.","His delivery from the stretch takes a bit longer than I'd like to see. He is balanced throughout his delivery though. Although his velocities aren't spectacular, he commands his pitches very well to get batters out.",He didn't really have to make any fielding plays in this one.,"He's a little on the skinny side, which may explain the low velocities.
